The code seems to have problems with sorting the output correctly.  This especially becomes problematic when Aces are involved.

It also seems to be finding cards when there isn't a duplication. For example, 
(
        "High Card Multiple",
        [
            ["Kc","7h","Qd","Js","6s"],
            ["Kd","7s","Qs","Jd","5s"],
        ],
        "High Card  ['Kc', 'Qd', 'Js', '7h', '6s']"
    ),

The code gives an error that a hand does not have 5 unique valid cards but this is not true.
